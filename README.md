# MeetApp 

Alice, Bob, Carl and you reside in the same city, and want to meet up at a happening place on the weekend. After all, everyone needs some deep conversations over a beer after an unremarkable week, don't they? Or maybe it's your birthday and you want to spend it with the people you really care about, but don't have the patience to search for the most convenient place to have fun. 

Sounds familiar? 

**MeetApp is the one stop solution for all the hassles pertaining to planning your meetup.** Enter the locations of all the interested friends, and bam! The app suggests possible cafes / pubs / restaurants where you could all meet. These are ranked according to what would be the most convenient places for the group, taking your preference over luxury and time flexibility into account. 

## How to Plan your Meetup

Open the app and just start your plan!

Note:
- The locations can be entered as text or sent via the "Send Location" button. 
- To start a new plan at any point in the flow, just tap the menu button and select "New Plan"

Happy planning!
